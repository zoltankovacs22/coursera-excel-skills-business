Logical Functions I: IF

1. Question 1
How many arguments are expected by the IF function?
1.Three
2. Question 2
Using the IF function to determine the maximum of 2 cells A1 and B1 the coding could look like:
2.=IF(A1>B1,A1,B1)
3. Question 3
If we want to report whether A1 and B1 are the same in value using the IF function, the coding could look like:
3.=IF(A1=B1,"same","")
4. Question 4
If we want to report whether A1 and B1 are different in value using the IF function, the coding could look like:
4.=IF(A1=B1,"","different")
