The INDEX MATCH allows us to look up more than one value simultaneously.
2. Question 2
Which of the following arguments are required by the INDEX function?
2.row_num, array
3. Question 3
What part of the INDEX function does MATCH replace and why?
3.MATCH is used to define the second and/or third argument, i.e., the row or column parameter, of the INDEX function. By using MATCH instead of defining this manually, the function becomes a lot more versatile and automated.
