Which of the options below best describes how SUMPRODUCT works ?
1.SUMPRODUCT finds the product of multipe arrays and then sums up the products.
2. Question 2
A colleague is unsure what order the arrays need to be entered in the SUMPRODUCT function. What is the best response to this?
2.It is actually not necessary to use a particular order when placing the arguments in SUMPRODUCT.
3. Question 3

4.False
5. Question 5
When using SUMPRODUCT to calculate the total marks of students in Column G, for efficiency, which array will need to be in absolute cell referencing terms?
5.$B$3:$F$3
6. Question 6
For the Excel worksheet below, typing either of the following two formulas in cell G5 will return the same answer:
