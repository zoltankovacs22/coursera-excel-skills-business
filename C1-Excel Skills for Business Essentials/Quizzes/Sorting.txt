Sorting

1. Question 1
Sean wants to sort his data set by Order Quantity. He single-clicked on the column letter Q to select the column and presses Sort & Filter on the Home tab and selects Sort Largest to Smallest. Which of the options below shows what his spreadsheet will look like next?
1.Is this what he will see?
2. Question 2
You need to sort a large and rather untidy data set that you just received from a different department. It contains entries such as dates, numbers and text. Before you use the Sort tool, what should you do first? (One or more answers are possible - partial credit will be awarded)
2.Make sure that the number format for each of the columns is consistent, e.g. Currency, Accounting, Percentage.
Add headers to the data set.
3. Question 3
Sean wants to order a subset of his data by Order Priority. He wants to see the Critical items first, followed by High, Medium, Low and then Not Specified. However, there might be a slight problem - can you guess what it is?
3.Excel does not understand text on a conceptual level, in other words, it will sort this column in the following order: Critical, High, Low, Medium, Not Specified.
4. Question 4
Sean has been asked to sort the Name column of his data set in ascending order. What does that mean given that his column contains text, not numbers?
4.Ascending order means that he needs to sort his data from A to Z.
