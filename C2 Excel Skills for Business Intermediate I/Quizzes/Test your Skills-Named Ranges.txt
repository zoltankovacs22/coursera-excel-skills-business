Test your Skills: Named Ranges

1. Question 1
A travel expenses template has been compiled for your company to make it easier for staff to record their expenses when travelling to branches in other countries. It has recently been updated and the named ranges have been damaged in the process so most of the formulas are returning an error. You need to correct the named ranges to fix the problem.
Have a look at the Travel Expense worksheet. Note there are quite a few errors. Start by addressing the problem of the missing exchange rates by naming the ranges. Go to the Currency Rates worksheet and use Create from Selection to name all the rates (A4:B12) using the labels in column A.

2. Question 2
While the calculation of Other Expenses is looking better it is still not correct. Open the Name Manager. There is a range called Coffee that is no longer used, so delete it. Now have a look at Ex_Rate, it only goes to row 14, which explains the incorrect calculation. Edit it to go from L11:L21. Click OK and close the Name Manager.

E15:J18- Paris
E19:J21- Mumbai
Now go to the Summary By Region worksheet and observe the calculated values for London. What was the total amount spent in London in USD (D4)?

9. Question 9
Click in D7 and use Autosum to get the total spent in USD. If we were to now name the range D4:D6, would the formula just created in D7 automatically change to use the named range? You should not actually create this named range.
9.No, but you could use the Apply Named Range to apply it.
10. Question 10
Click in B9 (still in Summary By Region), and use the Paste Names tool to Paste all the named ranges into your workbook. What value is in B25?
