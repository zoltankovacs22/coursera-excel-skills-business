Fix Dates (DATE, MONTH, YEAR, DAY, TEXT)

1. Question 1
If cell A1 contains the formula =DATE(2027,3,6) what value will be returned in cell A1?
1.A value corresponding to the date of 6 March 2027.
2. Question 2
If cell A1 contains the formula =DATE(2017,12,1) and cell B1 contains the formula =TEXT(A1,"ddd") what value will be returned in cell B1?
2.Fri
3. Question 3
In the video, cell F2 contained the text string 2014.01.21 and the cell G2 formula =TEXT(F2,"mmmm") was seen to return 2014.01.21 and not the value January. Why did the formula at cell G2 behave this way?
3.Because if the cell being referred to by the TEXT function is recognized by Excel as containing text, a number format of "mmmm" specified in the TEXT function has no effect.
