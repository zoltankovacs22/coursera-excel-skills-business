1. Question 1
What of these statements best describes what the TRIM function does to a text string?
1.Removes all spaces from text except for single spaces between words.
2. Question 2

2.When we want to remove some non-printable characters from a text string.
3. Question 3
In the video, we saw in cell B2 the formula =TRIM(CLEAN(Data!B2)) being typed and then copied down the column. What would have happened if instead the formula =CLEAN(TRIM(Data!B2)) was typed and copied instead?
3.There would have been no difference to the results. These two formulas would produce identical values in column B.
