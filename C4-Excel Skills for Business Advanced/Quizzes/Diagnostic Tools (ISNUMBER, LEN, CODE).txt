Diagnostic Tools (ISNUMBER, LEN, CODE)

1. Question 1
Which of these statements best describes the behaviour of the ISNUMBER function?
1.Checks whether a value is a number, and returns TRUE or FALSE.
2. Question 2
In the video, the CODE function was applied to a string exactly 1 character in length, since the string was the result of a RIGHT([cell reference],1) function. What would happen if we applied the CODE function to a string of more than 1 character in length?
2.We would get the code result of the first character in the string.
3. Question 3
If cell A1 contains a text string between 10 and 15 characters long, and we wish to write a formula that returns an identical text string except with the first two and final two characters removed, which of the following formulas will do this?
3.=MID(A1,3,LEN(A1)-4)
